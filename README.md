# CigBurger Backoffice project

## What is this?

This is my version from the cigburger backoffice from the course "[2024] CodeIgniter 4 - 3 large PROFESSIONAL projects united by APIs | MVC | PHP8 | MySQL | All about one structure!" (This is only a third of the course project, check CigKitchen and CigRequest in my profile)

## What you'll need

1. Database from CigBurger Backoffice
    1. Start creating a database called "db_cig_burger"
    2. Add a user called "user_db_cig_burger" with the password "ren7hICOqosAqu8Es7wagIjuD6KI4o"
    3. Open the terminal and run "php spark migrate" to create the table structure
    4. Optionally, execute "php spark db:seed <seed_name>" in your terminal to populate the database with initial data.
